<BR>
<BR>
<TT>This driver is Build 0.48 of the NVIDIA Reference Driver. This <BR>
release of the display driver is to be used with boards based on the RIVA TNT <BR>
chip. This release includes drivers for both WinNT4.0 and Win95/98 in either an <BR>
AGP or PCI configuration. This Reference Driver is supplied to board <BR>
manufacturers for their use in developing fully supported drivers customized for <BR>
their specific board configuration. While we expect this driver to operate correctly <BR>
on RIVA TNT based boards, we are not able to provide full product support for <BR>
other manufacturers products. It is recommended that end users install the <BR>
drivers supplied from their board manufacturer to receive full product support.</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>If you were using a Win95 driver from a board manufacturer that also provided a <BR>
Control Panel applet, (like Diamond's InControl Tools, STB's Vision, etc.) that <BR>
applet will not work correctly with the NVIDIA Reference Driver and can cause <BR>
system problems. It should be removed before these new drivers are installed. <BR>
(See Installing from non-NVIDIA drivers, below.)</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>System Requirements to use the NVIDIA Reference Drivers</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Win95 System requirements:<BR>
- OSR2 for full AGP functionality (which includes Microsoft's OPENGL32.DLL)<BR>
- Microsoft's OPENGL32.DLL<BR>
- Microsoft's Dx5 or greater<BR>
- 2MB disk space</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Win98 System requirements<BR>
- Microsoft's Dx5 or greater<BR>
- 2MB disk space</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>WinNT System requirements:<BR>
- Service Pack 3 <BR>
- 2MB disk space</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Downloading the NVIDIA Reference Drivers: </TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>To download the Build 0.48 Reference Drivers begin by <BR>
clicking on the correct driver version for your system. </TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>select W9x048p.ZIP to install drivers on Win95 AGP systems<BR>
select W9x048ag.ZIP to install drivers on Win95/98 AGP systems<BR>
select NT4048.ZIP to install drivers on WinNT systems</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>This will download the compressed driver to your system. Save it in a temporary <BR>
directory on your system disk.<BR>
	example: c:\RIVATNT<BR>
The following sections will help you install our latest Win95/98 or WinNT display <BR>
drivers which include the OpenGL ICD driver.</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Win95 Installation Information: </TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Before installing the new drivers it is recommended that you have a copy of your <BR>
current drivers, usually supplied with your board. </TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>If not previously installed, you will need to install these on your system first:</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>1. OSR2 or later for AGP systems (usually pre-installed on AGP systems). &nbsp;<BR>
(Optionally, the USB supplement is needed for full AGP functionality. This should <BR>
have<BR>
been included with your system or motherboard. See your system <BR>
manufacturer's web site for this file.)<BR>
2. Install Dx5 or greater (the final version of Dx6 is recommended). This is <BR>
contained in your board vendor's drivers, on the Microsoft web site, or on a <BR>
recent DirectX application. It is recommended you install the latest Service Pack <BR>
from Microsoft. You can obtain this by browsing for &quot;Support Drivers, Patches <BR>
and Service Packs&quot; \ &quot;Windows 95 Updates&quot; from: &nbsp; &nbsp;<BR>
</TT><TT><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/default.htm</a></TT><TT><BR>
The final version of Dx6 can be obtained from:<BR>
</TT><TT><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/directx/default.asp</a></TT><TT><BR>
3. If you have OSR2 or later installed on your system you should already have <BR>
Microsoft's OPENGL32.DLL installed on your system. If you do not already have <BR>
a version of OPENGL32.DLL in your Windows\System, or you have another <BR>
vendor specific OPENGL32.DLL file installed, you need to install Microsoft's </TT><BR>
<TT>OPENGL32.DLL. You can obtain this file and other required files from:<BR>
</TT><TT><a href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/opengl95.exe">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/opengl95.exe</a></TT><BR>
<BR>

After selecting the correct path press &quot;OK&quot;. <BR>
Click &quot;OK&quot; twice to install the new drivers. Close down the open windows.<BR>
7. After successfully installing the reference drivers, you will need to restart the <BR>
operating system for the new drivers to take effect.</TT><BR>

<BR>
<TT>If not previously installed, you will need to install this on your system first:</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>1. Install Microsoft's Service Pack 3 for Windows NT 4.0 on your system. You <BR>

<BR>
<TT>Installing from non-NVIDIA drivers:</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>If you are installing the NVIDIA Reference Drivers and presently have non-<BR>
NVIDIA supplied drivers installed, it is recommended that you uninstall your <BR>
existing driver's Control Panel tools before installing the NVIDIA Reference <BR>
Drivers. Our driver does not include the hooks in it to support the tools provided <BR>
by other board manufacturers. As a result, their tools will not operate correctly <BR>
with the NVIDIA Reference Drivers and could cause system problems if you try <BR>
to use them with our drivers. The best way to uninstall drivers is to use an <BR>
uninstall utility provided by your board manufacturer. Please contact them for <BR>
information on how to uninstall their tools. </TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Uninstalling NVIDIA drivers:</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>If you have a need to do this, first start by uninstalling Control Freak. To do this <BR>
use the Add/Remove Programs dialog box:<BR>
Click Start, then Settings, then Control Panel.<BR>
Start the &quot;Add/Remove Programs&quot; applet program. <BR>
Select Control Freak, and click &quot;Add/Remove&quot;.<BR>
You will now be able to re-install your original driver on the system.</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>General information for all users.</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>About OpenGL:<BR>
The NVIDIA Reference Driver Build 0.48 includes our latest <BR>
version of the OpenGL ICD for RIVA TNT. This OpenGL ICD is now available for <BR>
both Windows 95 and Windows NT. &nbsp;It accelerates rendering of OpenGL <BR>
applications when:<BR>
 &nbsp;- Display is set to 16-bits per pixel or 32-bits per pixel<BR>
 &nbsp;- Enough video memory exists to support the OpenGL resolution requested<BR>
 &nbsp;- Microsoft's OPENGL32.DLL is correctly installed</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Several pre-release versions of the OpenGL ICD have previously been made <BR>
available through the Internet. This version should be much more stable, and <BR>
should perform better in almost all cases.</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Microsoft's OpenGL will auto-detect that the RIVA products have hardware-<BR>
accelerated OpenGL available, and use that whenever possible. &nbsp;If OpenGL <BR>
applications complain about missing &nbsp;required DLL's, or if you are seeing <BR>
unusual OpenGL behavior, then it is likely that either you are missing <BR>
OPENGL32.DLL, or that an application shipped with a version of <BR>
OPENGL32.DLL that is not compatible with the RIVA OpenGL ICD. &nbsp;You should <BR>
look in the application's directory for a file called OPENGL32.DLL, and rename it. <BR>
The application will then use the OPENGL32.DLL from the Windows\System or <BR>
WinNT\System32 directory. You also can obtain the correct OPENGL32.DLL is <BR>
by re-installing it from the WindowsNT CD.</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>About Control Freak:</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Also included in the NVIDIA Reference Drivers is our Control Panel applet, <BR>
Control Freak. This applet adds a RIVA tab to the Display Properties Dialog box. <BR>
There are several useful controls and setting information here. To learn what <BR>
each setting can do, just right click on the setting to get an information box.</TT><BR>
