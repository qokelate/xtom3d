<TT>Release 2.77 Release Notes</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>This driver is Release 2.77 of the NVIDIA Reference Driver. <BR>
This release of the display driver is to be used with boards <BR>
based on the RIVA128 and RIVA 128ZX chips. This release <BR>
includes drivers for both WinNT4.0 and Win95/98 in either an <BR>
AGP or PCI configuration. This Reference Driver is supplied <BR>
to board manufacturers for their use in developing fully <BR>
supported drivers customized for their specific board <BR>
configuration. While we expect this driver to operate <BR>
correctly on RIVA based boards, we are not able to provide <BR>
full product support for other manufacturers products. It is <BR>
recommended that end users install the drivers supplied from <BR>
their board manufacturer to receive full product support.</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>This release includes support for DirectX 6.0 (DX6), multi-<BR>
monitor configurations, and AMD CPUs with 3DNow!.</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>If you were using a Win95 driver from a board manufacturer <BR>
that also provided a Control Panel applet, (like Diamond's <BR>
InControl Tools, STB's Vision, etc.) that applet will not <BR>
work correctly with the NVIDIA Reference Driver and can <BR>
cause system problems. It should be removed before these <BR>
new drivers are installed. (See Installing from non-NVIDIA <BR>
drivers, below.)</TT><BR>
<BR>

<BR>
<TT>Downloading the NVIDIA Reference Drivers: </TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>To download the Release 2.77 Reference Drivers begin by <BR>
clicking on the correct driver version for your system. </TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>select WIN9xPCI.ZIP to install drivers on Win95 PCI systems<BR>
select WIN95AGP.ZIP to install drivers on Win95 AGP systems</TT><BR>
<TT>select WIN98ALL.ZIP to install drivers on Win98 AGP or PCI </TT><BR>
<TT> &nbsp; systems<BR>
select NT40R128.ZIP to install drivers on WinNT systems</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>This will download the compressed driver to your system. <BR>
Save it in a temporary directory on your system disk.</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>	example: c:\RIVA128</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>The following sections will help you install our latest <BR>
Win95/98 or WinNT display drivers which include the </TT><BR>
<TT>OpenGL ICD driver.</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Win95 Installation Information: </TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Before installing the new drivers it is recommended </TT><BR>
<TT>that you have a copy of your current drivers, usually </TT><BR>
<TT>supplied with your board. </TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>If not previously installed, you will need to install <BR>
these on your system first:</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>1. OSR2 or later for AGP systems (usually pre-installed <BR>
 &nbsp; on AGP systems). &nbsp;<BR>
2. Install Dx5 or greater. This is contained in your </TT><BR>
<TT> &nbsp; board vendors drivers, on the Microsoft web site, or </TT><BR>
<TT> &nbsp; on a recent DirectX application. It is recommended </TT><BR>
<TT> &nbsp; you install the latest Service Pack from Microsoft. </TT><BR>
<TT> &nbsp; You can obtain this by browsing for &quot;Support Drivers, </TT><BR>
<TT> &nbsp; Patches and Service Packs&quot; \ &quot;Windows 95 Updates&quot; &nbsp;from: &nbsp; &nbsp;</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT> &nbsp; </TT><TT><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/default.htm</a></TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>3. If you have OSR2 or later installed on your system </TT><BR>
<TT> &nbsp; you should already have Microsoft's OPENGL32.DLL </TT><BR>
<TT> &nbsp; installed on your system. If you do not already have </TT><BR>
<TT> &nbsp; a version of OPENGL32.DLL in your Windows\System, or </TT><BR>
<TT> &nbsp; you have another &nbsp; &nbsp;vendor specific OPENGL32.DLL file </TT><BR>
<TT> &nbsp; installed, you need to install Microsoft's OPENGL32.DLL. </TT><BR>
<TT> &nbsp; You can obtain this file and other required files from:</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT> &nbsp; </TT><TT><a href="ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/opengl95.exe">ftp://ftp.microsoft.com/Softlib/MSLFILES/opengl95.exe</a></TT><BR>

<BR>
<TT>WinNT Installation Information:</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Before installing the new drivers it is recommended </TT><BR>
<TT>that you have a copy of your current drivers, usually </TT><BR>
<TT>supplied with your board. </TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>If not previously installed, you will need to install </TT><BR>
<TT>this on your system first:</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>1. Install Microsoft's Service Pack 3 for Windows </TT><BR>
<TT>NT 4.0 on your system. You can obtain this by browsing </TT><BR>
<TT>for &quot;Support Drivers, Patches and Service Packs&quot; \ <BR>
&quot;Windows NT Service Packs&quot; &nbsp;from: &nbsp; &nbsp;</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT> </TT><TT><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/default.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/msdownload/default.htm</a></TT><TT><BR>

<TT> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Release 2.77<BR>
6. After NT successfully installs the reference drivers, <BR>
 &nbsp; you will need to restart the operating system for <BR>
 &nbsp; the new drivers to take effect.</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Installing from non-NVIDIA drivers:</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>If you are installing the NVIDIA Reference Drivers and <BR>
presently have non-NVIDIA supplied drivers installed, </TT><BR>
<TT>it is recommended that you uninstall your existing </TT><BR>
<TT>driver's Control Panel tools before installing the </TT><BR>
<TT>NVIDIA Reference Drivers. Our driver does not include </TT><BR>
<TT>the hooks in it to support the tools provided by other </TT><BR>
<TT>board manufacturers. As a result, their tools will not </TT><BR>
<TT>operate correctly with the NVIDIA Reference Drivers and </TT><BR>
<TT>could cause system problems if you try to use them with </TT><BR>
<TT>our drivers. The best way to uninstall drivers is to use </TT><BR>
<TT>an uninstall utility provided by your board manufacturer. </TT><BR>
<TT>Please contact them for information on how to uninstall </TT><BR>
<TT>their tools. </TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Uninstalling NVIDIA drivers:</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>If you have a need to do this, first start by uninstalling <BR>
Control Freak. To do this use the Add/Remove Programs <BR>
dialog box:</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT> &nbsp; Click Start, then Settings, then Control Panel.<BR>
 &nbsp; Start the &quot;Add/Remove Programs&quot; applet program. <BR>
 &nbsp; Select Control Freak, and click &quot;Add/Remove&quot;.<BR>
 &nbsp; You will now be able to re-install your original driver <BR>
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;on the system.</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>General information for all users.</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>About OpenGL:<BR>
The NVIDIA Reference Driver Release 2.77 includes our <BR>
latest version of the OpenGL ICD for RIVA 128 and </TT><BR>
<TT>RIVA 128ZX. This OpenGL ICD is now available for both </TT><BR>
<TT>Windows 95 and Windows NT. &nbsp;It accelerates rendering of </TT><BR>
<TT>OpenGL applications when:</TT><BR>
<TT><BR>
 &nbsp;- Display is set to 16-bits per pixel<BR>
 &nbsp;- Enough video memory exists to support the OpenGL </TT><BR>
<TT> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;resolution requested<BR>
 &nbsp;- Microsoft's OPENGL32.DLL is correctly installed</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Several pre-release versions of the OpenGL ICD have <BR>
previously been made available through the Internet. <BR>
This version should be much more stable, and should <BR>
perform better in almost all cases.</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Microsoft's OpenGL will auto-detect that the RIVA </TT><BR>
<TT>products have hardware-accelerated OpenGL available, </TT><BR>
<TT>and use that whenever possible. &nbsp;If OpenGL applications </TT><BR>
<TT>complain about missing required DLL's, or if you are </TT><BR>
<TT>seeing unusual OpenGL behavior, then it is likely that </TT><BR>
<TT>either you are missing OPENGL32.DLL, or that an </TT><BR>
<TT>application shipped with a version of OPENGL32.DLL that </TT><BR>
<TT>is not compatible with the RIVA OpenGL ICD. &nbsp;You should </TT><BR>
<TT>look in the application's directory for a file called </TT><BR>
<TT>OPENGL32.DLL, and rename it. The application will then </TT><BR>
<TT>use the OPENGL32.DLL from the Windows\System or </TT><BR>
<TT>WinNT\System32 directory. You also can obtain the correct <BR>
OPENGL32.DLL is by re-installing it from the WindowsNT CD.</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>About Control Freak:</TT><BR>
<BR>
<TT>Also included in the NVIDIA Reference Drivers is our <BR>
Control Panel applet, Control Freak. This applet adds a <BR>
RIVA tab to the Display Properties Dialog box. There are <BR>
several useful controls and setting information here. To <BR>
learn what each setting can do, just right click on the <BR>
setting to get an information box.</TT><BR>
